# Foody-Cook-Book
Foody Cook Book application brings you random food recipes when you launch the application. This app uses Free Meal API to get the random meal every time the app is launched. You can bookmark the food receipe you like.

Used Retrofit to get Gson data from the api. 

I have used "www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php" api to get the random meal.

Used MVVM pattern to maintain single functionality per classes. And Livedata to hold the data from active Activity and it can be observed by the same.

Used Room Database to store bookmarked/favorite recipes.

Below is the screenshot of the running application:
